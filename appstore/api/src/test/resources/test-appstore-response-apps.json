      "description": "Muninn is an extremely lightweight battery estimation app that uses the Wakeup API instead of the Background Worker to monitor battery trends and provide insight without negatively affecting battery life. It uses a moving average of six-hourly readings over time to estimate remaining days of battery life and rate of discharge.\n\nEstimates will begin to appear after two of these readings have been taken.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Negligible battery impact.\n- Moving-average estimation of remaining battery life, weighted towards recent values.\n- Display of last observed charge and predicted next charge date.\n- Notifies when there is about one day of charge remaining.\n- Attempt to set AppGlance to show estimate in the launcher menu.\n- View detailed logs of recent estimates.\n- View general battery tips and Muninn lore.\n- Ability to disable temporarily.\n- Completely delete and reset all app data.\n\nOptions:\n- Vibrate when a sample is taken.\n- Advise when battery charge is below a chosen threshold (50%/20%/10%).\n- Set a timeline pin at noon the day charge may run out.\n- Be notified if the rate of drain is 2x average.\n\nImportant notes:\nIf the watch is off at the next six-hourly interval, the app must be launched to allow wakeups to be resumed. The initial estimate may be an overestimate but will smooth out soon after. Any missed wakeups will be ignored.",

      "description": "Challenge yourself to drink more water for better health! Health experts recommend drinking at least a half gallon (8 cups) of water every day. Drinking enough water can help you lose weight by controlling your appetite, boosting your metabolism, and aiding your digestion.\r\n\r\nIs 8 cups a day too easy for you? Aim for a whole gallon of water! In the 30-day water challenge, you challenge yourself to drink a gallon of water every day for 30 days straight. People who have completed this challenge report a wide range of beneficial results, such as weight loss, more energy, less headaches, better mood, softer hair, and healthier looking skin.\r\n\r\nWith Gallon Challenge, you can help yourself drink more water by keeping count of how much water you drink each day, and how many days in a row you've met your goal. The app also keeps track of statistics such as the total amount of water you've recorded consuming and the length of your longest streak.\r\n\r\nYou can customize your drinking goal to be either a half gallon or whole gallon of water each day. The unit that you drink in can be customized to either ounces, cups, pints, or quarts. You can change the hour that your day starts at in case you have an irregular schedule.\r\n\r\nNew in version 2! Set reminders to drink water. You can either choose how often you want to be reminded, or use Auto reminders to let the app evenly space them out throughout the day to keep you on track for reaching your goal. These reminders won't bother you while you sleep, because it uses your \"End of Day\" setting to know approximately what time you are asleep.",

If Gentle Wake was not open before the DST Check then it immediately closes so it should not interfere with anything running.\r\n\r\nAlso improved skipping alarms (hold Up on main screen with no active alarm) so up to 6 days can be skipped by repeatedly holding and releasing the Up button. Holding Up after 6 days skipped, cycles back to no skips and disabling & re-enabling alarms or changing settings also resets the skipping.",

      "description": "- Alarms for each day of the week\r\n- Smart Alarm attempts to wake you if it detects you stirring shortly before the alarm time, which is the Monitor Period (doesn't interfere with background activity apps)\r\n- All settings are in-app (Down button on main screen) \r\n- Alarm vibration starts gentle and gets longer and longer to gradually wake you and this can be adjusted with the Vibration Pattern setting\r\n- Alarm will vibrate for just over a minute and will then auto-snooze to save battery\r\n- Doesn't need to be manually started for the alarms to work (set and forget)\r\n- While Alarm is vibrating, a single click on any button snoozes the alarm. 2 quick clicks are required by to turn off the alarm to reduce the chance of accidentally turning it off\r\n- Change the 'Stop Alarm' setting to 'Konami Code' to show a random sequence of buttons to turn off the alarm to help really make sure you are awake\r\n- Dynamic snooze halves the initial snooze time on each snooze until it reaches 3 minutes - for those of us with a habit of hitting snooze repeatedly ;)\r\n- Can temporarily disable all alarms (Single Up button click on main screen)\r\n- 'Easy Light' - hold your Pebble vertically to turn on the backlight while the alarm is vibrating/snoozing (no need to shake your wrist!). Can be turned off.\r\n- Skip alarms by holding Up on the main screen and choose a date to skip until (alarms restart on that date.) Disabling & enabling alarms, or going into the settings resets skips\r\n- DST Check sets the day of the week on which it checks if your location has switched to/from Daylight Savings Time",
